    "description": "Traditional credit was built for people who already have money. Requirements for credit history, collateral, and costly underwriting create insurmountable barriers for those who need capital most—over 1\\.4 billion people lack access to credit. A vendor in Lagos earns cash daily but can't prove steady income. A Colombian nurse with years of perfect informal repayments remains invisible to banks. Even those with savings find themselves excluded. The economics are clear: serving the global majority remains structurally unprofitable for traditional institutions.\n\n\nWe abandoned these assumptions to create Credit. Instead of expensive verification, we use progressive trust\\-building: loans start small and can grow to USD $1,000\\+. In Argentina—where staggering inflation causes banks to routinely fail—over 20,000 people use Credit for groceries, medicine, and transportation. They call it \"la salvación del mes\"—the month's salvation. Undercollateralized lending at scale. As borrowers build trust, default rates have approached zero. Word spreads: 140,000 people now wait for access.\n\n\nBacked by Paradigm and Nascent, we're building not charity but a profitable system serving those whom banks structurally cannot. We see an encouraging future: Instantaneous. Universal. Algorithmic by design. The technology exists. The demand is massive. Join us in making credit a human right, not a privilege.\n\n**About the role**\n==================\n\n\nWe're looking for a frontend engineer to lead the development of our World MiniApp, which is a website for mobile rendered through the World app. You should be an expert in Next.js and fluent in TypeScript, React, and Tailwind.\n\n\nWhile speed is crucial, we place equal emphasis on quality, rigor, and optimization. Our app needs to perform smoothly for users worldwide, especially those using lower\\-end phones.\n\n\nWorking closely with the founding team, you'll ship frequently and make a direct impact on thousands—if not millions—of lives.
